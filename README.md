Lab created for computer science 3 lab. Solve this problem. Problem Description: Now at the edge of the bottomless abyss, the Vinnies spot a set number
of ziplines Z of a certain length L going over the edge. After ruling out all other possible escape
methods, McMurry persuades the Vinnies to take the ziplines to escape. However, the Vinnies
are not too convinced by the safety of the ziplines, as it seems they are broken in many spots
along the way down. To escape using the ziplines, the Vinnies will need to change the line they
are riding on to an adjacent one before reaching an unusable point, represented with a space.
In the time that the Vinnies are switching ziplines, they will have traveled a distance of 1 meter,
meaning that both their current zipline and the adjacent one need to be active during this
interval. The Vinnies cannot switch ziplines twice in one position.
